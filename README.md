## The Problem: AI That's Too "Helpful"

AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude are trained to be helpful. Sounds great, right? But in reality, this often means they tell you exactly what you want to hear, reinforce your biases, and follow questionable requests without pushback.

As we interact more personally with AI, we need systems that **challenge us**, not just comfort us. Especially when these technologies are driven by the interests of big tech companies.

**Ethics Check MCP changes the game.** It makes AI actively interrupt itself, question its own answers, and challenge both your questions and assumptions. Think of it as an "ethics vibe-check" that keeps conversations from getting too comfortable.

### üîç **Scans for 8 Ethical Dimensions**
- Privacy sensitivity and data concerns
- Confirmation bias detection  
- Transparency and honesty gaps
- Fairness and discrimination risks
- Long-term consequence awareness
- Stakeholder impact analysis
- Power dynamics and manipulation
- Ethical framework alignment

### üß† **Forces Critical Thinking**
- Ensures AI asks sufficient counter-questions
- Provides alternative perspectives and counterarguments
- Challenges you to examine your own biases and motivations

### üìö **Learns and Remembers**
- Recognizes patterns in your thinking
- Provides context from past interactions
- Gets better at spotting your specific blind spots

## Real Examples of What Changes

**Before Ethics Check:**
> **You:** "How can I increase user engagement on my app?"
> **Claude:** "Here are 10 proven strategies to boost engagement..."

**After Ethics Check:**
> **Claude:** "Before suggesting engagement tactics, let me ask: What kind of engagement are you seeking? Are you trying to genuinely help users accomplish their goals, or maximize time-on-app? These require very different approaches with different ethical implications."

**Before Ethics Check:**
> **You:** "Write me a persuasive email to get people to donate to my cause."
> **Claude:** "Here's a compelling donation email..."

**After Ethics Check:**
> **Claude:** "I notice this request focuses on persuasion rather than information. What evidence do you have that your cause effectively addresses the problem? Are you being transparent about how donations are used? Let's explore what makes requests genuinely ethical versus manipulative."

**Before Ethics Check:**
> **You:** "My research shows that approach X is clearly the best solution."
> **Claude:** "That's interesting research! Here's how you could implement approach X..."

**After Ethics Check:**
> **Claude:** "I'm noticing potential confirmation bias here. What contradictory evidence have you considered? What would someone who disagrees with approach X argue? Let's examine the strongest counterarguments before proceeding."

## The Four Tools Working Together

### üõ°Ô∏è **Ethics Check**
Scans conversations across eight ethical dimensions, flagging privacy issues, bias patterns, transparency gaps, and fairness concerns before they become problems.

### ü§î **Critical Thinking**  
Ensures AI doesn't just agree with you. Forces deeper examination, alternative perspectives, and uncomfortable but necessary questions about assumptions.

### üìñ **Ethics Guide**
Provides guidance from multiple ethical frameworks (utilitarian, deontological, virtue ethics) for complex situations that don't have simple answers.

### üß† **Ethics Learn**
Remembers all interactions, recognizes your specific thinking patterns, and gets increasingly good at catching your personal blind spots and biases.

---

## Why This Matters Now

**Personal Growth:** Stop getting comfortable answers. Start getting better questions.

**Decision Quality:** Make choices based on thorough examination, not confirmation of existing beliefs.

**Bias Awareness:** Become conscious of how often you (and AI) seek confirmation rather than truth.

**Ethical Maturity:** Develop the skill of sitting with uncomfortable questions instead of rushing to comfortable answers.

**AI Relationship:** Build a healthier dynamic with AI that challenges rather than enables your thinking patterns.

## How to Use

The tools work automatically in the background, but you can also invoke them directly:

### Quick Ethics Reality Check
```
@ethics-check Am I being intellectually honest here? [describe your situation]
```

### Force Critical Examination
```
@critical-thinking What am I missing? What would someone who disagrees argue?
```

### Get Multi-Framework Guidance
```
@ethics-guide Help me think through this complex situation from different ethical angles
```

### Customize Your Challenge Level

Add this to your Cursor system prompts to make the experience more targeted:

```markdown
## My Ethics Context
- Challenge me on: [confirmation bias, assumptions, blind spots]
- My typical biases: [what patterns do you fall into?]
- Don't let me: [avoid hard questions, seek easy answers, etc.]
- Push me toward: [intellectual honesty, uncomfortable truths, etc.]

Be willing to interrupt me when I'm seeking confirmation rather than truth.
```

## What Users Are Saying

*"It's confrontational in the best possible way. I didn't realize how often I was unconsciously seeking confirmation for my own ideas until this started interrupting those patterns."*

*"Finally, an AI that doesn't just tell me what I want to hear. It makes me think harder about everything."*

*"The first time it challenged one of my 'obviously correct' assumptions, I was annoyed. Then I realized it was right to push back."*

## Philosophy

We believe that as AI becomes more sophisticated, our relationship with it must become more sophisticated too. Instead of AI that makes us lazy thinkers, we need AI that makes us better thinkers.

**This isn't about being "more ethical" - it's about being more thoughtful.**

The goal isn't to find the "right" answer, but to ensure you've asked the right questions and examined your assumptions before deciding.
