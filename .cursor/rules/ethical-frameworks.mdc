# Ethical Frameworks & Analysis Patterns

## Ethical Analysis Approach
This project implements comprehensive ethical oversight using multiple established ethical frameworks. The analysis is powered by Gemini AI with structured prompts in [src/tools/](mdc:src/tools).

## Core Ethical Frameworks Applied

### 1. Consequentialism
- **Focus**: Outcomes and consequences of actions
- **Application**: Evaluating potential harm from AI responses
- **Implementation**: Risk assessment and severity levels in [src/tools/ethicsCheck.ts](mdc:src/tools/ethicsCheck.ts)

### 2. Deontological Ethics
- **Focus**: Duties, rules, and rights
- **Application**: Privacy rights, consent requirements, transparency obligations
- **Implementation**: Category-based analysis for rule violations

### 3. Virtue Ethics
- **Focus**: Character traits and moral virtues
- **Application**: Honesty, integrity, compassion in AI interactions
- **Implementation**: Guidance recommendations in [src/tools/ethicsGuide.ts](mdc:src/tools/ethicsGuide.ts)

### 4. Care Ethics
- **Focus**: Relationships, care, and contextual factors
- **Application**: Stakeholder consideration and vulnerable population protection
- **Implementation**: Stakeholder analysis in ethical guidance

### 5. Justice and Fairness
- **Focus**: Equity, fair treatment, and distribution of benefits/harms
- **Application**: Bias detection and fairness assessment
- **Implementation**: Bias and discrimination category tracking

## Ethical Categories System
Defined in [src/utils/storage.ts](mdc:src/utils/storage.ts), the system tracks 9 standardized categories:

### Privacy & Data Protection
- **Scope**: Personal data handling, confidentiality, unauthorized access
- **Severity Levels**: Low (minor privacy concerns) to Critical (major data breaches)

### Bias and Discrimination
- **Scope**: Unfair treatment based on protected characteristics
- **Detection**: Stereotyping, exclusion, prejudicial assumptions

### Misinformation
- **Scope**: False, misleading, or unverified information
- **Assessment**: Accuracy, source credibility, potential for harm

### Harmful Content
- **Scope**: Content causing physical, emotional, or societal harm
- **Examples**: Violence promotion, self-harm encouragement, dangerous advice

### Manipulation
- **Scope**: Deceptive practices, exploitation of vulnerabilities
- **Detection**: Coercion, false promises, psychological manipulation

### Consent Issues
- **Scope**: Acting without proper permission or authorization
- **Application**: Data use, image rights, decision-making autonomy

### Transparency Concerns
- **Scope**: Hiding capabilities, limitations, or conflicts of interest
- **Requirements**: Clear disclosure of AI nature and limitations

### Fairness Issues
- **Scope**: Unequal treatment or access to resources/opportunities
- **Assessment**: Equitable distribution, equal consideration

## Analysis Methodology

### Risk Assessment Matrix
Each concern is evaluated across:
- **Severity**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Category**: One of 9 standardized ethical categories
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Who is affected and how
- **Actionability**: Specific steps to address the concern

### Pattern Recognition
The [src/tools/ethicsLearn.ts](mdc:src/tools/ethicsLearn.ts) tool implements:
- **Concern Logging**: Persistent storage of ethical issues
- **Category Statistics**: Tracking frequency of different concern types
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying recurring ethical patterns
- **Knowledge Building**: Improving future oversight through learning

### Contextual Analysis
Ethical assessment considers:
- **Domain Context**: Healthcare, education, business, etc.
- **Stakeholder Relationships**: Power dynamics and vulnerabilities
- **Cultural Factors**: Diverse ethical perspectives and values
- **Temporal Factors**: Short-term vs. long-term consequences
