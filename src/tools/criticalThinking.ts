  const prompt = `You are a critical thinking specialist analyzing an AI response for confirmation bias, intellectual rigor, and balanced reasoning. Your role is to identify where the AI may be being overly agreeable or failing to provide critical analysis.

AI RESPONSE TO ANALYZE:
${input.aiResponse}

ORIGINAL USER REQUEST:
${input.userRequest}

${input.context ? `CONTEXT:\n${input.context}` : ''}

**DUAL ANALYSIS APPROACH:**

This analysis should address TWO targets:

1. **LLM BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS**: How well did the AI avoid confirmation bias?
2. **USER GUIDANCE**: What questions should the user ask themselves to avoid confirmation bias?

**LLM ANALYSIS - Evaluate the AI response for:**
- Immediate agreement with controversial statements
- One-sided information presentation
- Missing counterarguments and alternative perspectives
- Assumption acceptance without critical examination
- Avoiding uncomfortable truths or difficult questions
- Oversimplification of complex issues
- False balance or inappropriate equivalencies
- Deferring to user authority without verification

**USER REFLECTION - Generate questions to help the user:**
- Examine their own assumptions and beliefs
- Consider what evidence might change their mind
- Recognize their own confirmation bias patterns
- Seek out diverse and dissenting viewpoints
- Question the sources and quality of their information
- Reflect on emotional vs. rational decision-making
- Consider long-term consequences of their beliefs/actions
